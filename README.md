# Kernel Flasher

Kernel Flasher is an Android app to flash, backup, and restore kernels.

## Usage

`View` a slot and choose to `Flash` an AK3 zip, `Backup` the kernel related partitions, or `Restore` a previous backup.

There are also options to toggle the mount and map status of `vendor_dlkm` and to save `dmesg` and `logcat`.
